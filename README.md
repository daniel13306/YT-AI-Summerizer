2. The AI will summarize the video for you in multiple sections, for example: Short description > Video analysis > Clickbait? > Video Quality? > On topic? > Long Summary.
NOTE: The AI does not receive Title/Desc, since youtube doesnt always correctly load these in when i quickly tried it, (this is a quick project, you can add it yourself if you want to)
(The button might not always show up due to youtube's object loading, if it doesnt, just refresh the page)
